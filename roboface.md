Original idea for roboface come from P. Burgess work done for Adafruit.
I tried to adapt what was possible to a single matrix on a PewPew featherwing using CircuitPython.

// Requires Adafruit_LEDBackpack and Adafruit_GFX libraries.
// For a simpler introduction, see the 'matrix8x8' example.
//
// This sketch demonstrates a couple of useful techniques:
// 1) Addressing multiple matrices (using the 'A0' and 'A1' solder
//    pads on the back to select unique I2C addresses for each).
// 2) Displaying the same data on multiple matrices by sharing the
//    same I2C address.
//
// This example uses 5 matrices at 4 addresses (two share an address)
// to animate a face:
//
//     0     0
//
//      1 2 3
//
// The 'eyes' both display the same image (always looking the same
// direction -- can't go cross-eyed) and thus share the same address
// (0x70).  The three matrices forming the mouth have unique addresses
// (0x71, 0x72 and 0x73).
//
// The face animation as written is here semi-random; this neither
// generates nor responds to actual sound, it's simply a visual effect
// Consider this a stepping off point for your own project.  Maybe you
// could 'puppet' the face using joysticks, or synchronize the lips to
// audio from a Wave Shield (see wavface example).  Currently there are
// only six images for the mouth.  This is often sufficient for simple
// animation, as explained here:
