pewpew-experiments

This repository contains experiments I do with pewpew
Pewpew is both hardware and software built by Radomir Dopieralski

Some information here: https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

When code is working on emulator and hardware, it is located in universal forler.
If there is specific code, like deep copy for roboface, I put code in corresponding folders, board and emulator.
